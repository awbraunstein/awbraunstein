## Work

Currently, I'm a **Member of Technical Staff** at [*OpenAI*](https://www.openai.com) where I'm working on the developer platform team.

Previously, I was a:

- **Software Engineering Manager** at [*Covariant*](https://www.covariant.ai) 🤖 🧠

  I worked on making building AI based robotics applications easier.

- **Senior Software Engineer** - [*YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com)
  
  At YouTube I worked on everything from improving accessibility for our menus and buttons, to speeding up our templating engine, to shifting the codebase from a monolithic Python app to C++ microservices and everything in between. While at Google, I was also a member of the Go readability approver team where I was one of the core reviewers for Go code across Google's codebase.
  
## Personal

In my free time I enjoy rock climbing 🧗 and snowboarding 🏂.
